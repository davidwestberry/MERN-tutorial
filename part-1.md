# MERN Tutorial - Part 1
In part 1 of the MERN tutorial, I will provide a brief explaination of the MERN stack and each of the 4 technologies involved in building a MERN application. I will also walk through a very basic web application. This first web app will not use all 4 technologies, it is intended only to gain a rudimentary understanding of a Node.js application

# M - E - R - N
When discussing application development, it is common to hear developers refer to various "stacks" that are used to build applications. A "stack" simply describes which tools and frameworks were used to build the application. The MERN "stack" uses **M**ongoDB as the databaase backend, **E**xpress as the server-side web framework, **R**eact as the front-end (or client-side) framework, and because Express is a Javascript framework, and Javascript is typically executed in the browser, we need some way to execute Javascript on a server. This is where **N**ode.js comes in.
